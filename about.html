                            Hi, It’s Selim! 
                            I’m a robotics, entrepreneurship, and music enthusiast, who is working his way into the world of computer science. My last initiative was a youth-led NGO that supports high schoolers by bringing them together with professionals, <a href="https://www.horizonankara.com/" target="_blank">Horizon</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Thanks to coding training at BILSEM, I’ve discovered my interest in computer science, which eventually led me to become a proud founder and captain of the robotics team, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/flrobotics" target="_blank">FLrobotics</a>. 
                            My interests are mainly focused on neural networks, music theory, and neuroscience.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Along with academics, I also enjoy composing music. You can check my works on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3hI6oZYGI2n3QVyvPJ0E62?si=hGOGdR5tTOexGJECVOSHNw" target="_blank">Spotify</a>. Feel free to connect with me via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/selimaltintop/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, I would love to hear about your feedback or discuss collaborations.
